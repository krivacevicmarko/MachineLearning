# Machine learning
In these projects, tasks were performed with the aim of applying some basic machine learning algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, k-NN classification, decision trees, and neural networks. Standard machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used
